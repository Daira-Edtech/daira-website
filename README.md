        # Daira EdTech – R&D Lab for Impact

Daira EdTech is an impact-focused research and development lab working at the intersection of education, accessibility, and public systems. The work centers on building solutions for communities that traditional products and services often overlook, with a strong emphasis on inclusive education and government-scale deployment.

## Vision

Daira exists to prove that cutting-edge technology can serve the 90% of people who are usually left out of innovation. The goal is to design, validate, and scale systems that make early intervention, inclusive learning, and equitable access a default, not an exception.

## What This Project Includes

- Public-facing website that tells the story of Daira's work and philosophy
- Sections for who the team is, how the lab operates, and why it is different from typical organizations in the space
- Impact storytelling through case studies, metrics, and real-world deployments
- Clear paths for partners, institutions, and collaborators to reach out and start working together

## Core Pillars

### 1. Research-first approach
The work begins with deep on-ground research: understanding families, teachers, administrators, and policy makers before designing any solution. Prototypes are tested and refined in real environments, not just in controlled settings.

### 2. Built with public systems
Solutions are designed to work with government programs, public schools, and large-scale initiatives. Rather than operating at the margins, the lab focuses on embedding tools into existing systems so impact can scale sustainably.

### 3. Inclusion at the center
Every product and initiative is guided by inclusion: children with disabilities, rural learners, multilingual contexts, and communities that face systemic barriers. Accessibility is treated as a foundation, not an add-on.

### 4. Evidence and implementation
Impact is measured through real deployments: number of children reached, districts covered, and reduction in time or friction for critical processes like screening and intervention. Evidence from these deployments informs policy conversations and future design.

## Key Impact Area – Jiveesha

One of the flagship initiatives is an AI-assisted neurodevelopmental screening platform designed to bring early identification and support to children at scale. It is used in partnership with public institutions and has been deployed across multiple districts. The focus is on:

- Large-scale, multilingual screening
- Support for professionals during assessment and follow-up
- Practical workflows for schools and government programs

## Who This Is For

- Public institutions and government bodies looking to scale inclusive education and early intervention
- Foundations, CSR initiatives, and nonprofits seeking partners with deep research and implementation capability
- Universities, research groups, and domain experts interested in collaborating on long-term, evidence-based projects

## How to Contribute or Partner

- Reach out through the "Partner With Us" or contact section on the site
- Share context about your region, program, or challenge area
- Explore pilots, research collaborations, or long-term implementation partnerships aligned with inclusive education and social impact

## Guiding Principles

- **Impact over optics** – Success is measured in lives improved and systems changed, not just in metrics or marketing
- **Long-term commitments** – Work is designed around multi-year initiatives, not quick campaigns
- **Co-creation** – Solutions are built with teachers, administrators, families, and local experts, not just for them
- **Transparency** – Clear communication about goals, limitations, and evidence is a core value

## Contact

If this mission resonates with you, you can:

- Start a conversation about pilots or deployments
- Explore research collaborations in areas like early intervention, accessibility, and inclusive learning
- Discuss how existing programs or policies can be strengthened with the lab's work
